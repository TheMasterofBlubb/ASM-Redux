# ASM-Redux
Arma Server Monitor rework to fit 64bit and be compatible with the original Tools and files

If you stumbled upon this : Welcome to my first ever Github repo ;)

This is a small rewrite of the ASM (Arma Server Monitor) originally by Fred

Sadly i cant tell wich Version is originally was, but its the only one where i got a matching Feature set in the RV_Extension and Monitor Application.

You are free to use it in your Arma community. 

I know that the Project is not really super clean but it works just fine for now and i might refrector the code some time later.

The Monitor App and Addon are originally created by Fred and are not changed.

Same goes for the Config file. If you happen to have one from good ol' times it will work straight forward.

The target of the project was to port the ASM to 64 bit to have it functioning in some way.
Goal achieved! 


INSTRUCTION

There is a ready to go @asm -Addon folder in the Tools Folder. Put that into your Mod Directory of Arma 3 and add it to the loaded Mods. Then Start the Monitor Application and thats it.

It Supports upto 4 Arma Instances.
There is some way of reading the Data remotely from the Monitor Application, but i couldnt find a proper manual for the Version i had(although reading the other manuals i found it seems to be easy, will add the original manuals when time comes).
